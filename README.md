Module 20 Challenge - Credit Risk Classification

For this project, I used supervised machine learning to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk data.

# Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

# Results

The accuracy of predicting a healthy loan (0) is 100%.  The accuracy of predicting a high-risk loan is 91%.  So the model does a better job of predicting a healthy loan than it does predicting a high-risk loan.
